    K-API is a fast, secure, and lightweight proxy API for VRChat.  
    It handles authentication via VRChatâ€™s official API, including 2FA support,  
    and provides cached endpoints for user and group information retrieval.  

    This project is designed for developers who want a hassle-free way  
    to integrate VRChat data into their apps without managing sessions or tokens manually.  

    Features:
    - Automatic token management with 2FA handling
    - Public and private VRChat data endpoints
    - Response caching for performance
    - Easy deployment on self-hosted servers (YunoHost compatible)
    
    Built with FastAPI and async HTTPX for high performance and reliability.
